# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

BrandyDocs is a documentation and planning repository for a proposed AI-powered brand governance SaaS platform targeting marketing agencies. This is currently in the **research and planning phase** with no actual code implementation yet.

**Mission**: Make 5,000 brand agencies more profitable through centralized AI prompt and content management.

## Repository Structure

- `docs/` - Contains all project documentation and research
  - `brandydocs-foundational-business-direction.md` - Core business strategy and mission
  - `brandydocs-design-research.md` - Comprehensive design and branding strategy (295 lines)
  - `market-analysis.md` - Market viability and investment analysis with 47 citations (231 lines)
  - `first-draft-homepage.html` - Complete HTML prototype of product homepage (243 lines)

## Key Architecture Concepts

### Target Architecture (When Development Begins)
- **Frontend**: Modern web application (HTML prototype uses Tailwind CSS + Alpine.js)
- **Backend**: Multi-tenant SaaS platform for agency-client relationships
- **Core Feature**: "Alignment Principles" management system for brand voice control
- **AI Integration**: Content regulation (not generation) through prompt management

### Design Guidelines (from design-research.md)
- **Typography**: Playfair Display for headlines, Inter for UI text
- **Color Scheme**: Dark theme (#121212 background) with gold accent (#E6B856, #D48F3A)
- **Approach**: "Sophisticated Synthesis" - minimalist foundation with expressive details
- **Target Audience**: Design-savvy marketing agency decision-makers

## Business Context

### Problem Statement
Marketing agencies struggle with managing AI-generated content across multiple client brands, risking reputation damage from off-brand content.

### Solution
Centralized "command center" for managing brand voice through Alignment Principles - acting as content regulator rather than generator.

### Target Market
- 400,000+ global advertising/digital agencies
- Focus on smaller agencies (1-50 employees)
- "Land and expand" strategy: start with one client per agency, expand to portfolio

## Development Notes

### Current State
- **No package.json, dependencies, or build system** - pure documentation phase
- **No git commits yet** - repository is in initial state
- **Ready for technical implementation** - all research and planning complete

### When Moving to Development
1. The HTML prototype in `docs/first-draft-homepage.html` provides complete design reference
2. Multi-tenant architecture will be essential for agency-client model
3. Focus on premium positioning - target audience expects exceptional design quality
4. Start with MVP focused on core Alignment Principles management system

### Research Quality
All documentation includes extensive citations and market research. The foundation is exceptionally well-researched and positioned for successful SaaS product development.
